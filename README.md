JaamSim is a Java based discrete-event simulation environmen. rviz is a 3D visualizer for the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. The Eclipse SysON project provides web-based tooling to edit SysML v2 models. Java-based implementation of the OMG SysML-Modelica Transformation (SyM) using MagicDraw SysML. Modelica Development Tooling is a plugin that integrates OpenModelica compiler with Eclipse. MoDE is a graphical editor for modelica diagrams. JModelica is a software platform based on the Modelica modeling language for modeling, simulating, optimizing and analyzing complex dynamic systems. Assimulo is a simulation package for solving ordinary differential equations. Modelica3D is a lightweight, platform independent 3D-visualisation library for Modelica. PathSim is a flexible block-based time-domain system simulation framework. FMI4j is a software package for dealing with Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) on the JVM. OMWebbook is an interactive notebook and a web-based Modelica-Toolbox. OpenMCx is an extendable, tool-neutral co-simulation framework. RobotML stands for Robot Modelling language. LWJGL is a Java library that enables cross-platform access to popular native APIs useful in the development of graphics (OpenGL, Vulkan, bgfx), audio (OpenAL, Opus), parallel computing (OpenCL, CUDA) and XR (OpenVR, LibOVR, OpenXR) applications. Modelica library for interactive simulation. Library for fault modelling in Modelica. The SMArtInt Library is designed to integrate various artificial intelligence (AI) models seamlessly into Modelica-based simulation tools. ModelicaGym toolbox was developed to employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) for solving optimization and control tasks in Modelica models. This software provides the user a tool (sdf2modelica) and a C++ library to convert 3D rigid body mechanical systems described by the Gazebo Simulator's Simulation Description Format files to Modelica models that use the Mechanics MultiBody library.
