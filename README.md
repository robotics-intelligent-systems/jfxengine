# JFXEngine

MechatronicUML is a Model-Driven Software Development tool-chain for cyber-physical systems. The Eclipse SysON project provides open-source web-based tooling to edit SysML v2 models. Java-based implementation of the OMG SysML-Modelica Transformation (SyM) using MagicDraw SysML. Modelica Development Tooling is a plugin that integrates OpenModelica compiler with Eclipse. MoDE is a graphical editor for modelica diagrams. Esoterica Engine is an MIT licensed prototype game engine framework. MARCO is a prototype compiler for the Modelica language and is based on the LLVM / MLIR compiler technology. JModelica is a software platform based on the Modelica modeling language for modeling, simulating, optimizing and analyzing complex dynamic systems. Modelica3D is a lightweight, platform independent 3D-visualisation library for Modelica. PathSim is a flexible block-based time-domain system simulation framework. FMI4j is a software package for dealing with Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) on the JVM. OMWebbook is an interactive notebook and a web-based Modelica-Toolbox. OpenMCx is an extendable, tool-neutral co-simulation framework. RobotML stands for Robot Modelling language. The Intel Graphics Compiler for OpenCL is an LLVM-based compiler for OpenCL targeting Intel graphics hardware architecture. Modelica library for interactive simulation. Library for fault modelling in Modelica. The SMArtInt Library is designed to integrate various artificial intelligence (AI) models seamlessly into Modelica-based simulation tools. ModelicaGym toolbox was developed to employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) for solving optimization and control tasks in Modelica models. This software provides the user a tool (sdf2modelica) and a C++ library to convert 3D rigid body mechanical systems described by the Gazebo Simulator's Simulation Description Format files to Modelica models that use the Mechanics MultiBody library.
