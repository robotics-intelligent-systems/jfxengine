JFXEngine is an Apache 2.0-licensed multi-platform 3D engine. Creative Artificial Intelligence for Computer Graphics. O3DE, a real-time open source 3D engine, can be used to create robotic simulations and immersive 3D worlds. LWJGL is a Java library that enables cross-platform access to popular native APIs useful in the development of graphics (OpenGL, Vulkan, bgfx), audio (OpenAL, Opus), parallel computing (OpenCL, CUDA) and XR (OpenVR, LibOVR, OpenXR) applications. The UEFMI plugin allows for the use of dynamic simulation models via Functional Mockup Units (FMUs) directly in a Universal Unreal Engine VR Mod project.
