# JFXEngine

Esoterica Engine is an MIT licensed prototype game engine framework. It’s intended as a technology demonstrator, an educational tool and an R&D framework. MARCO is a prototype compiler for the Modelica language and is based on the LLVM / MLIR compiler technology. Business Simulation Library (BSL) - A library for modeling & simulation of dynamical systems in the social sciences, e.g., business/economics, and ecology using the System Dynamics metaphor. JModelica is a software platform based on the Modelica modeling language for modeling, simulating, optimizing and analyzing complex dynamic systems. Modelica3D is a lightweight, platform independent 3D-visualisation library for Modelica. FMI4j is a software package for dealing with Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) on the JVM. OMWebbook is an interactive notebook and a web-based Modelica-Toolbox. OpenMCx is an extendable, tool-neutral co-simulation framework. RobotML stands for Robot Modelling language. LWJGL is a Java library that enables cross-platform access to popular native APIs useful in the development of graphics (OpenGL, Vulkan, bgfx), audio (OpenAL, Opus), parallel computing (OpenCL, CUDA) and XR (OpenVR, LibOVR, OpenXR) applications. The Intel Graphics Compiler for OpenCL is an LLVM-based compiler for OpenCL targeting Intel graphics hardware architecture. Bullet Physics SDK s a real-time collision detection and multi-physics simulation for VR, games, visual effects, robotics and machine learning. O3DE, a real-time open-source 3D engine, can be used to create robotic simulations and immersive 3D worlds. This software provides the user a tool (sdf2modelica) and a C++ library to convert 3D rigid body mechanical systems described by the Gazebo Simulator's Simulation Description Format files to Modelica models that use the Mechanics MultiBody library. The IdealizedContact Library is a free Modelica package for modeling and handling of collisions in MultiBody Systems. esmini is a basic OpenSCENARIO XML player
