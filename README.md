Modelica3D is a lightweight, platform independent 3D-visualisation library for Modelica. Rascal meta-programming language (including interpreter, type checker, parser generator, compiler and open source ECMA CLI, C# and .NET implementation. OpenMCx is an extendable, tool-neutral co-simulation framework. Sulong is a high-performance LLVM bitcode runtime built on the GraalVM by Oracle Labs. This includes languages like C/C++, Fortran, and others. RobotML stands for Robot Modelling language. It is semi-graphic language created in order to allow robotician to think of their problems without immediately thinking on what actual it will work. LWJGL is a Java library that enables cross-platform access to popular native APIs useful in the development of graphics (OpenGL, Vulkan, bgfx), audio (OpenAL, Opus), parallel computing (OpenCL, CUDA) and XR (OpenVR, LibOVR, OpenXR) applications. The Intel Graphics Compiler for OpenCL is an LLVM-based compiler for OpenCL targeting Intel graphics hardware architecture. Bullet Physics SDK s a real-time collision detection and multi-physics simulation for VR, games, visual effects, robotics and machine learning. O3DE, a real-time open-source 3D engine, can be used to create robotic simulations and immersive 3D worlds. Godot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface. This software provides the user a tool (sdf2modelica) and a C++ library to convert 3D rigid body mechanical systems described by the Gazebo Simulator's Simulation Description Format files to Modelica models that use the Mechanics MultiBody library. JModelica is a software platform based on the Modelica modeling language for modeling, simulating, optimizing and analyzing complex dynamic systems. The IdealizedContact Library is a free Modelica package for modeling and handling of collisions in MultiBody Systems. esmini is a basic OpenSCENARIO XML player.
