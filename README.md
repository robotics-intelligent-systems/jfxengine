# JFXEngine

Sulong is a high-performance LLVM bitcode runtime built on the GraalVM by Oracle Labs with Sulong you can execute programming languages that can be transformed to LLVM bitcode on GraalVM. This includes languages like C/C++, Fortran, and others. RobotML stands for Robot Modelling language. It is semi-graphic language created in order to allow robotician to think of their problems without immediately thinking on what actual it will work. LWJGL is a Java library that enables cross-platform access to popular native APIs useful in the development of graphics (OpenGL, Vulkan, bgfx), audio (OpenAL, Opus), parallel computing (OpenCL, CUDA) and XR (OpenVR, LibOVR, OpenXR) applications. The Intel Graphics Compiler for OpenCL is an LLVM-based compiler for OpenCL targeting Intel graphics hardware architecture. Bullet Physics SDK s a real-time collision detection and multi-physics simulation for VR, games, visual effects, robotics and machine learning. O3DE, a real-time open-source 3D engine, can be used to create robotic simulations and immersive 3D worlds. Gazebo is an open-source 2D/3D robotics simulator. This software provides the user a tool (sdf2modelica) and a C++ library to convert 3D rigid body mechanical systems described by the Gazebo Simulator's Simulation Description Format files to Modelica models that use the Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody library. The UEFMI plugin allows for the use of dynamic simulation models via Functional Mockup Units (FMUs) directly in a Universal Unreal Engine VR Mod project. CCOM VisLab's VR Point Cloud Editor Unity Project. Simulation of Autonomous Vehicles In Unity. This project uses methodologies from the Udacity Car Simulator and Microsoft's Airsim
